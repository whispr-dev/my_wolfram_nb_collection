# welcome to wofl's wolfram noteboo collection:

so, here it does exactly what it says on the tin - it's just my collected wolfram notebooks that aren't strictly associated with other projects so don't have a home on my specific project gits!


as can be expected they'ree all in wolfram language and quite math laden for the most part.
there's very little actual code ina any one notebook generally being little experiments toying with sm0l ai's or ca or whatever but soem do take a fair bit of resoruces for such simpole mathematical curiosities.

for those curious about what's under the hood and knwo squat, it's basically a form of lsp hooked up to a dirty great cloud computinb resource taht feels more like a jpyter notebook with incredible built in computing power as best i can ddescribe it.

they extremely uic to run up a quick' ai brain idea or to explore things like the mathematicl quirks that aee cellular automata etc.

oh,  and it oinly costs about $27/mon which made cancellign discorb nitro and temp chatGPT evry easy choice - now i have both GPT4o and wolfram and i feel all powerful. : D

one project i haev in mind that i havent even allowed myself to thinkabout atall is m0delling 3d mid-side using the code from the mystic circuits mdoiule that does 4waymid-side and see if i can get one of those graphs of 3d stnding waves in audio-airpressure etc. from wolframs demos you canget crazy high resolution and it works very well for modelli ng such things indeed.

i have, amongst other things, modelled my ai brain idea from the jellyfishsockjaw/lobsterpot in a wolfram note booka and tho i got distracc  by failing at audoio i/o i did have it running pictures through it and ofc the og random data init. 

i do  intend to finishup testing with that ai brain by actuaklly training it and running some benchmarks just to see how well it really does perform in real world concrete comparable terms. tho that wpuld somehw0 involve deciding what it's aimed at doing or specialising in - which frankly i have no clue cos i just slather it on everything.

there's gonna ofc always be lil treats to e found for newcomers to this trove but also an ongoing hints at what's particularly fresh n current in my mind as far as project ideas etc. so keep an eye on this one cos it could e an early warning system.
